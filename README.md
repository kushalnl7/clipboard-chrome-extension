                +---------------------------+
                |        Webpage           |

                            |
                [ injected.js ]  ← runs in page context
                            |
           window.postMessage({ text })

                |  (content script sandbox) |
                +---------------------------+
                            |
              chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ text })
                            ▼
                +---------------------------+
                |      background.js        |
                |  (persistent background)  |
                +---------------------------+
                            |
                chrome.storage.local.set()
                            ▼
                +---------------------------+
                |         popup.js          |
                | (popup.html + style.css)  |

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Clipboard Tracking
- `injected.js` runs inside web pages and listens for `copy` events.
- When the user copies any text, it grabs the selection and sends it via `window.postMessage(...)`.

### 2. Message Bridging
- `content.js` listens for that message.
- It uses `chrome.runtime.sendMessage(...)` to relay the copied text to the background script.

### 3. Storage
- `background.js` listens for those messages and stores the copied texts in `chrome.storage.local`, avoiding duplicates and trimming to 20 entries.

### 4. Popup UI
- `popup.html` loads `popup.js`, which fetches and displays stored history.
- Search bar filters results live.
- Clicking a text copies it back to clipboard and shows a toast.
- Each entry includes a delete icon to remove that item.
